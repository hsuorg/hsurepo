#How to Open a Rez File on Mac

**1. You may notice the files included with the Rezonator EXE are harder to access on Mac. That’s because they are within the EXE’s package contents.

  2. In order to open the package contents, Command Click on the EXE within your Applications folder. This will show a dropdown menu, with the option “Show Package Contents”


  3. Click on the “Show Package Contents” option to open the Contents folder. Within the Contents folder, open the Resources folder. In the Resources folder are a few useful things, but for now open the includedfiles folder and then the data folder.
