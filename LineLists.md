1.1	How to use the Line List
=====
### Functionality of the Unit Tab

The Line List is activated in two ways: activating Unit Mode, or by Left Mouse Clicking the Unit Tab within the List Window. 

### Functionality of the Line List

While in Unit Mode, the List Window will display a list of all the Lines within the Dialog:

The display of the lines is similar to the Main Screen: Line Number on the far left, Speaker Label in the middle, then on the right side is a display of Lineâ€™s text.
Another way to focus a line is to Left Mouse Click the anywhere in the lines within the Line List.

### Functionality of the Contents Window

The window to the right of the List Window is the Contents Window, which displays both Token Level Contents and Unit Level Contents.
The current Display Level is based on the 1-to-Many/1-to-1 Button. When set to 1-to-Many, the Contents Window will display Token Level Contents

The Token Level Contents are split into columns: 2 default Rezonator columns, TokenID and Order, along with any other Markers set to Token Level in the Import Process.

On the non-default column headers are two buttons: the Change Field Button and the Display Token Button.

The Change Field Button, activated by a Left Mouse Click, will open a dropdown menu. Selecting an option from this menu will replace the current column with the selected column.

The Display Token Button, when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will set that column to be the Display Column. This changes the current Tokens displayed in the Main Screen to the Tokens within the selected column.

Within the Token Level Columns are the Contents themselves, accompanied by the Change Tag Button.

By Left Mouse Clicking the Change Tag Button, you can create a new Tag, and insert previously created Tags into the current cell.

When set to 1-to-Many/1-to-1 Button is set to 1-to-1, the Contents Window will display Unit Level Contents

The Unit Level Contents are listed for all visible Lines in the Line List, and are split into columns: 1 default Rezonator column, UnitID, along with any other Markers set to Unit Level in the Import Process.

The Button layout is identical to the Token Level Contents Window: present on the column headers are the Change Field Button and the Display Token Button, and next to the contents cells is the Change Tag Button.
