2.2 Trail Mode
=====
**Trail Mode** is one of the two **Annotation Modes** of Rezonator, the other being **Rez Mode**. The main purpose of Trail Mode is to allow the user to “track” references of subjects across the discourse, through the use of **Trail Chains**.

### 2.2.1	 Activating Trail Mode

Trail Mode can be activated by a **Mouse Click** on the **Trail Tool Pane Button**:

When Trail Mode is active, the Trail Tool Pane Button will be highlighted like so (see image above)

Alternatively, Trail Mode can be activated by pressing the “T” Key on your keyboard. Another way to activate Trail Mode is by selecting the Trail Tab within the **List Window**.

### 2.2.2	Functionality of Trail Mode

The most important feature of Trail Mode is the creation of Trail Chains. A Trail Chain is a sequential set of words connected by **Links**. A Trail Chain looks like this:

You can begin a Trail Chain by clicking on a **Word** in the discourse, creating the first Link in the chain

Press **enter** and a Trail Chain will be created, and it will be automatically **Focused**. When a chain is focused, Left Mouse Clicking on other words in the discourse will add those words to the focused chain.

If you want to no longer add words to a chain or start a new chain, you will need to **Unfocus** the currently focused chain. This is done multiple ways:
  * Left Mouse Clicking on the **Empty Space** in the Discourse.
  * Pressing the **Escape** key on your keyboard.

In order to **Refocus** a previous chain, you must Left Mouse Click on a word already within the chain. Also, you are able to **Merge Chains** together, combining one chain with another. This is done by Focusing one chain you want combined, then CTRL + Left Mouse Clicking (Command + Left Mouse Clicking on mac) on a word within the non-focused chain you want combined. A **Warning Window** will appear asking you to confirm the Merge. If you press “Yes”, the second Trail Chain will be merged into the First Trail Chain.

To **Delete** a Link  within a Trail Chain, **Right Mouse Click** on the word you want removed from the chain. A **Dropdown Menu** will appear, with one option being “Delete Link”. Clicking this option will remove the selected word from the Trail Chain.

Alternatively, you can Left Mouse Click on the word you want to remove from the Trail Chain, then press the **Delete Key** on your keyboard.

### 2.2.3	Functionality of Unit Mode

When in **Trail Mode**, the **Trail Chain List** can be found in the top 1/3rd of the window.

There are 2 buttons on the lines in **Trail Mode**: **Filter Chains Button** & **Visibility Button**. The Filter Chains Button (filter cone), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will add all active Trail Chains to the list of chains shown on the **Filter Screen**.

The Visibility Button (eyeball), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will toggle the visibility of all Trail Chains on the main screen.
