The main screen of Rezonator is our visual representation of the text imported delineated into tokens and units.

The main screen consists of four major sections:
  * The Workspace where the document is displayed and edited
  * The Tool Pane is the vertical section on the right
  * The Navigation Window is above both of those
  * Finally the Menu Bar is at the top of the screen


## 2.1 Workspace 

**Unit Mode** is the default **Mode** of Rezonator, which limits the userâ€™s ability to annotate the data, allowing for safe exploration of the data within the program. Unit Mode also features the **Line List** within the **List Window**. The functionalities of the Unit Mode are described below.
