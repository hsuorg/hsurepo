### 3.3 How to make Stack Chains

**Stack Chains are the third type of Chains within Rezonator, the other two being Rez Chains  and Trail Chains . The main purpose of Stack Chains is to allow the user to annotate entire lines in the discourse, instead of annotating word by word. Note: Stack Chains do not have a single Mode attributed to them, and are instead accessible in both Rez Mode and Trail Mode.**

### Accessing Stack Chain Creation
As noted above, Stack Chains can be made in either Trail Mode or Rez Mode. For now, we’ll show how to access Trail Mode:
Trail Mode can be activated by a Left Mouse Click on the Trail Tool Pane Button:

When Trail Mode is active, the Trail Tool Pane Button will be highlighted like so:

Alternatively, Trail Mode can be activated by pressing the “T” Key on your keyboard.
Another way to access Stack Chain creation is by Left Mouse Clicking the Stack Tab within the List Window.  

### Functionality of Stack Chains
Stack Chains can be used to annotate and organize lines of the discourse. A Stack Chain is a set of lines all highlighted the same color, which visualizes their Links . A Stack Chain looks like this: 

You can begin a Stack Chain by Left Mouse Clicking on the Speaker Label of a line in the discourse, creating the first Link in the chain.

Once a Stack Chain is created, it will be automatically Focused. When a Stack Chain is focused, Left Mouse Clicking on other Speaker Labels in the discourse will add those lines to the focused Stack Chain.

If you want to no longer add words to a chain or start a new chain, you will need to Unfocus the currently focused chain. This is done multiple ways:
Left Mouse Clicking on the Empty Space in the Discourse.
Pressing the Escape key on your keyboard.

In order to Refocus a previous chain, you must Left Mouse Click on a Speaker Label already within the chain. 
Also, you are able to Merge Chains together, combining one Stack Chain with another. This is done by Focusing one chain you want combined, then CTRL + Left Mouse Clicking on a Speaker Label within the non-focused chain you want combined. Note that Mac users should use Command instead of Control. A Warning Window will appear asking you to confirm the Merge. If you press “Yes”, the second Stack Chain will be merged into the First Stack Chain.

To Delete a Link  within a Stack Chain, Left Mouse Click on the word you want to remove from the Stack Chain, then press the Delete Key on your keyboard. This will remove the selected Line from the focused Stack.

### How to use the Stack Chain List

Stack Chain List - visualizing the active Stack Chains and their content
There are 2 buttons on the Tab: Filter Chains Button, & Visibility Button

The Filter Chains Button (filter cone), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will add all active Stack Chains to the list of chains shown on the Filter Screen.

The Visibility Button (eyeball), when activated by a Left Mouse Click, will toggle the visibility of all Stack Chains on the main screen.

Functionality of the Stack Chain List
While in Stack Mode, the List Window will display a list of all the Stack Chains you have created, as shown here:

Note: To the right of each Stack Chain’s name is a text readout of the Lines it contains.
Another way to Focus a Stack Chain is with a Left Mouse Click on the chain’s row within the Stack Chain List

On the left side of the Stack Chain’s name is the Pick Toggle Button. The Pick Toggle Button will add that Stack Chain to the list of chains shown on the Filter Screen.

More options for Stack Chains can be accessed with a Right Mouse Click on a chain’s row (CTRL & Mouse Click on Mac)

Rename lets you input a string to name the selected Stack Chain.
Recolor lets you choose a new color for the selected Stack Chain.
Delete will delete all of the links of the selected Stack Chain, eliminating the whole chain.

### How to use the Stack Chain Contents Window

With a Stack Chain focused, the Contents Window will display the contents of the focused Stack Chain

The Contents Window displays the individual Lines within a Stack Chain, showing their UID, Speaker, and Utterance.
The Contents of any Stack Chain can be sorted using the Sort Buttons next to the column’s name.

If you’re looking to add Tags to Stack Chains, then use the 1-to-Many/1-to-1 button on the right side of the screen between the Justify icon and Media icon. It is toggled with a Left Mouse Click

It’s default position is 1-to-Many, displaying only the focused Stack’s contents. Once toggled, it will be set to 1-to-1 and display the Tags of all the Stacks visible in the Stack Chain List

The Tags Window displays 3 tags per Stack Chain, in the categories of  Act, Repair, and Act Sequence.
Within each cell, to the right, is the Change Tag button. A Left Mouse Click on the Change Tag button will open a dropdown menu, which allows you to select a Tag to fill that cell, or add a new Tag Option for that category.
