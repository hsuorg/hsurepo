### 3.1.1	How to Open an Audio File
**The Audio functionality of Rezonator allows the user to listen to the dialog associated with the transcript being annotated. The user can play and pause the audio, set bookmarks within the audio track, and even select lines to play the audio of.**

In order to begin using audio in Rezonator, you’ll need to open an audio file. To do so, Left Mouse Click on the “Media” option from the “File” dropdown. Note: Rezonator only supports .OGG audio files.

If the audio file successfully imports, then the Audio Interface will appear, like so:


### 3.2.2	How to navigate the Audio Interface

On the leftmost panel, we display the name and file location of the current Audio Track:

At the top-middle portion of the interface is the Play/Pause Button. A Left Mouse Click on this button will play or pause the current Audio track. Also, pressing the Spacebar on you keyboard will play or pause the current Audio Track

On top of the Seek Bar is the Playhead, represented by an orange circle. This is a visual representation of what position in the current Audio Track is being played.

The Playhead can be clicked and dragged with a Left Mouse Hold to a different position on the Seek Bar, which will update the current position of the Audio Trail being played.

On the Right Most side of the Audio Interface is the Jump Audio Toggle Button. When this button is toggled on, and a Word on the Main Screen is Left Mouse Clicked, the Audio will jump to the Start Time of the Line that contains the word.

### 3.2.3	How to make an Audio Bookmark

A more advanced feature of Rezonator’s Audio capabilities is Audio Bookmarks, which are used to set custom start times for Audio playing.

Audio Bookmarks are created by pressing the Enter Key on the keyboard. Once the Enter Key is pressed, and Audio Interface is open, an Audio Bookmark will be placed at the current position of the Audio Playhead

The Audio Bookmark is visualized by a green triangle above the Seek bar. When an Audio Bookmark is present, pressing the Spacebar will set the Audio Playhead back to the position of the Audio Bookmark, in addition to playing/pausing the current audio file.
